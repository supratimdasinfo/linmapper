linmapper 0.0.9
===============

Developed by Supratim Das

Package Description
-------------------

linmapper is a Python package that allows users to transform vertices of
complex numbers from one plane (Z) to another plane (f(Z)). The package
includes a function called linmapper(Z, fZ) that takes in two sets of
arrays of complex numbers representing vertices of Z-plane and
f(Z)-plane, and returns the function f(Z) that transforms the vertices
from Z-plane to f(Z)-plane.

Installation
------------

To install linmapper, simply use pip:

.. code:: python

   pip install linmapper
   pip install numpy

Usage
-----

To use the linmapper() function, first import the package:

.. code:: python

   import linmapper as lmp
   import numpy as np

Then, create two arrays of complex numbers representing the vertices of
Z-plane and f(Z)-plane, respectively:

.. code:: python

   Z = np.array([-1+1j, 1+1j, 1+2j, -1+2j])
   fZ = np.array([-2-1j, -2+7j, -6+7j, -6-1j])

Finally, call the linmapper() function with these arrays as arguments:

.. code:: python

   lmp.linmapper(Z, fZ)

The function will return a function object that can be used to transform
any other complex number from Z-plane to f(Z)-plane.
